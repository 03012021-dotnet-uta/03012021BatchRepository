Challenge - Datatypes And Variables

YOu now know how to declare and initialize Variables.
1. In Main(), create a variable for each of the built-in (commonly called "primitive") datatypes.
   There are 15 of these. You can find the list at the link below these steps.
2. Initialize each variable with it's maximum or minimum value, if applicable (or reasonable).
3. In Main(), call the PrintValues() method with each of the variables you've created.
   You can do this because all data types inherit from the base "object" data type.
4. Follow the instructions in the PrintValues() XML Comments to fill in the body.
5. Next, create two values of type 'string'. 
   - The first one should say "I control text"
   - The second one should be a whole number as a string type (NOT an int). 
6. Call the StringToInt() method to convert the second string to an int type.

7. Print both values in the same console.WriteLine() statement using C# string interpolation.
8. Make sure to print the return from every method call to the console.
